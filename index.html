    <h3 id="legacy">Legacy</h3>
        <p>          Senna's accident is one of the saddest episodes in the history of the sport, but his death was responsible for a revolution in Formula 1 safety. The cars were made much safer and no fatal accident happened for nearly 20 years. In 2014, Frenchman Jules Bianchi ran into a tractor that was taking the car from another driver who had crashed seconds before. He was taken to a hospital in a coma and died nine months later. It was the only death in F1 after Senna.
        </p>
        <p>          Senna's greatest legacy is the Instituto Ayrton Senna, a non-profit organization that benefits more than 1.5 million Brazilian children per year, through the training of educators, educational projects and partnerships with public schools.
